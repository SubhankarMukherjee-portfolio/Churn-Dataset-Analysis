# Churn Dataset Analysis (Using Power BI)
This Power BI project analyzes telecom customer churn data to build interactive dashboards that uncover patterns in customer behavior, subscription trends, and churn drivers. It integrates demographic, account, service usage, and billing data to segment customers and identify risk factors associated with churn. Key metrics include churn rate, tenure distribution, monthly and annual charges, and support ticket volume. Visualizations include bar charts, distribution graphs, stacked columns, and heatmaps, offering detailed insights by internet service type, contract duration, payment method, and service subscriptions. The dashboards support strategic decisions in customer retention, contract optimization, and service delivery improvement by enabling users to explore churn trends and influential factors in an intuitive, data-driven format.

## Objectives of the project
1) To track and visualize customer churn metrics using KPIs such as churn rate, total customers at risk, average monthly and annual charges, and ticket volumes.
2) To identify key customer segments contributing to churn based on demographics, contract types, payment methods, and internet service usage.
3) To analyze tenure distribution and its relationship with churn to pinpoint vulnerable subscription durations.
4) To explore service usage patterns and their correlation with customer retention or churn.
5) To provide actionable insights through interactive Power BI dashboards, enabling data-driven decisions for improving customer retention, enhancing service offerings, and optimizing billing and support strategies.
   
## Questions solved
1) What is the overall churn rate among telecom customers?
2) How many customers are currently at risk of churning?
3) What are the average monthly and annual charges for the customer base?
4) How does churn distribution vary across contract types (month-to-month, one-year, two-year)?
5) Which payment methods are most commonly used by churned customers?
6) How does customer tenure relate to churn probability?
7) What is the churn rate by internet service type (Fiber Optic, DSL, No Service)?
8) How does service usage (e.g., streaming, device protection, tech support) influence churn?
9) What is the demographic breakdown (gender, senior citizen, dependents, partner) of customers who churn?
10) What percentage of churned customers use paperless billing?
11) How do admin and tech ticket volumes relate to churn behavior?
12) Which combinations of features (e.g., short tenure, electronic check payment, no partner) are most associated with churn?

## Final Observations & Storyline
The telecom churn analysis revealed that out of 7,043 customers, 1,869 had churned, resulting in a churn rate of 26.54%. Fiber Optic users showed the highest churn at 41.89%, compared to DSL and No-Internet users. Month-to-month contract holders (3.9K customers) accounted for the highest churn, while longer-term contracts showed more retention. Electronic check was the most churn-prone payment method, contributing to over $1.6M in monthly charges. Customers with tenure below 6 months (6.7K) were most likely to churn, reflecting poor early-stage experience. Paperless billing, chosen by 74.91% of users, correlated with higher churn, indicating a need to improve digital engagement. Demographic patterns showed that 34.2% of churned customers were senior citizens, while most lacked partners (44.2%) or dependents (78.9%). The average customer paid $74.4 monthly and $1,531.8 annually—potentially too high given the churn rate. Service usage patterns like Streaming TV (43.6%) and Multiple Lines (45.5%) didn’t prevent churn, suggesting they don’t ensure loyalty. Overall, churn is driven by a mix of short contracts, high costs, digital-only interactions, and unresolved support issues.
